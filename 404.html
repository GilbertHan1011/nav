You can see the list of current Babraham dates which are available, and you can contact us to discuss options for running courses on your site.</p><div>Comp790-166: Computational Biology</div><p>Modern, high-throughput assays allow us to efficiently profile a variety of biological processes to gain a systems-level understanding of health and disease. Recent technologies and experimental assays generate an abundance of detailed information that needs to be extracted, summarized, and interpreted. In this course we will discuss the methodology used to extract signal from (e.g. process, engineer features from, combine, etc.) data generated by some of the most cutting-edge experimental paradigms, such as single-cell assays and imaging. We will go into detail about the methods and theory underlying bioinformatics algorithms, originating from numerical linear algebra, graph-signal processing, and machine learning. While computational biology is a very broad field, we will focus here on applications in single-cell biology (CyTOF, single-cell RNA sequencing), multiomics/multi-modal analysis, systems immunology, and benchmarking. For each class of algorithms introduced for some task on biological data, we will also go over necessary theory and mathematical intuition. The course covers the foundations for biomedical data science and does not assume any biological knowledge.</p><div>Bioinformatics Tutorial By Lu Zhi</div><p>Bioinformatics Tutorial By Lu Zhi Lab</p><div>Computational Genomics with R</div><p>The aim of this book is to provide the fundamentals for data analysis for genomics.

An Introduction to Applied Bayesian Modeling</div><p>Bayesian statistics?! Once an obscure term outside specialized industry and research circles, Bayesian methods are enjoying a renaissance. The title of this book speaks to what all the fuss is about: Bayes Rules! Bayesian methods provide a powerful alternative to the frequentist methods that are ingrained in the standard statistics curriculum. Though frequentist and Bayesian methods share a common goal – learning from data – the Bayesian approach to this goal is gaining popularity for many reasons: (1) Bayesian methods allow us to interpret new data in light of prior information, formally weaving both into a set of updated information; (2) relative to the confidence intervals and p-values utilized in frequentist analyses, Bayesian results are easier to interpret; (3) Bayesian methods can shine in settings where frequentist “likelihood” methods break down; and (4) the computational tools required for applying Bayesian techniques are increasingly accessible. Unfortunately, the popularity of Bayesian statistics has outpaced the curricular resources needed to support it. To this end, the primary goal of Bayes Rules! is to make modern Bayesian thinking, modeling, and computing accessible to a broader audience.</p><div>An Introduction to Bayesian Data Analysis for Cognitive Science</div><p>This book is intended to be a relatively gentle introduction to carrying out Bayesian data analysis and cognitive modeling using the probabilistic programming language Stan (Carpenter et al. 2017), and the front-end to Stan called brms (Bürkner 2024). Our target audience is cognitive scientists (e.g., linguists, psychologists, and computer scientists) who carry out planned behavioral experiments, and who are interested in learning the Bayesian data analysis methodology from the ground up and in a principled manner. Our aim is to make Bayesian statistics a standard part of the data analysis toolkit for experimental linguistics, psycholinguistics, psychology, and related disciplines.</p><div>Overview | Learning Statistical Models Through Simulation in R</div><p>Textbook on statistical models for social scientists.</p><div>Summary | Mixed Models with R</div><p>This is an introduction to using mixed models in R.

Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data.</p><div>fasteR: Fast Lane to Learning R!</div><p>fasteR: Fast Lane to Learning R!</p><div>R in action</div><p>Good tutorial for R beginner</p><div>Deep R Programming</div><p>Deep R Programming is a comprehensive and in-depth introductory course on one of the most popular languages for data science.

Successful visualizations capitalize on our capacity to recognize and understand patterns presented in information displays.
Conversely, they require that writers of scientific papers, software designers and other providers of visual displays understand what works and what does not work to convey their message.
This course will examine a variety of issues related to data visualization from a largely psychological perspective, but will also touch upon other related communities of research and practice related to this topic:

history of data visualization,
computer science and statistical software,
visual design,
human factors.
We will consider visualization methods for a wide range of types of data from the points of view of both the viewer and designer/producer of graphic displays.</p><div>Milestones in the history of thematic cartography, statistical graphics, and data visualization.</div><p>The graphic portrayal of quantitative information has deep roots. These roots reach into histories of thematic cartography, statistical graphics, and data visualization, which are intertwined with each other. They also connect with the rise of statistical thinking up through the 19th century, and developments in technology into the 20th century. From above ground, we can see the current fruit; we must look below to see its pedigree and germination. There certainly have been many new things in the world of visualization; but unless you know its history, everything might seem novel.</p><div>Friends Don't Let Friends Make Bad Graphs</div><p>Friends don't let friends make certain types of data visualization - What are they and why are they bad.

Now in its twelfth edition, this classic text continues to lead with new information and cutting-edge developments, covering gene structure, sequencing, organization, and expression. Leading scientists provide revisions and updates in their respective areas of study offering readers current research and relevant information on the rapidly changing subjects in molecular biology. No other text offers a broader understanding of this exciting and vital science or does so with higher quality art and illustrations. Lewin's GENES XII continues to be the clear choice for molecular biology and genetics.</p><div>An Owner's Guide to the Human Genome: an introduction to human population genetics, variation and disease</div><p>In this book I describe the forces that govern genetic variation including mutation, drift, recombination and selection, as well as what genetics teaches us about human history, and the role of genetic variation in human phenotypes and diseases. When complete, the book will combine the three pillars of human population genetics - population genetics, population history, and trait genetics - under a single umbrella, with a focus on examples and applications in human genetics. Moreover, each section emphasizes the essential interplay between theory, statistical methods, and biological applications, with a focus on building intuition while avoiding heavy technical detail where possible.</p><div>Human Genome Variation</div><p>This is the course homepage and digital textbook for Human Genome Variation with Computational Lab</p></div><!-- nav.seo-end -->
